## Project Overview

This project is a Python-based weather comparison application. It fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities using a weather API and displays the results using bar charts. 

In this project, I worked on integrating an API with Python and understanding how data can be processed and visualized. The user enters an API key and city names separated by commas. The program then retrieves temperature and humidity data for each city.

The data is stored in lists and displayed using graphs. The hottest city is identified using a maximum temperature variable (max_temp) and is highlighted in red in the temperature comparison chart. 

This project helped me practice core Python concepts like loops, if-else conditions, lists, and working with external libraries such as requests and matplotlib.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To understand how APIs work.

- To fetch and handle JSON data in Python.

- To compare temperature and humidity of different cities.

- To visualize data using bar graphs.

- To find the maximum temperature using logical conditions.

- To build a simple and readable program structure.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python

- Requests Library

- Matplotlib Library

- Weather API

- Visual Studio Code

## How the Program Works

- The user enters an API key.

- The user enters city names separated by commas.

- The program sends API requests for each city.

- Temperature and humidity values are extracted.

- The highest temperature is calculated.

- Two graphs are displayed:

- Temperature Comparison

- Humidity Comparison

- The hottest city is highlighted and printed in the output.

## Features

- Real-time weather data fetching

- Temperature and humidity comparison

- Hottest city identification

- Bar chart visualization

- Simple and user-friendly structure

## Real-World Applications

- Weather monitoring systems  
- Travel and tourism planning  
- Climate data comparison dashboards  
- Educational projects for learning APIs  

## How to Run

Install required libraries:
```
pip install requests matplotlib
```

- Run the Python file.

- Enter your API key and city names when prompted.

## Conclusion 
This project demonstrates how real-time data can be integrated into a Python application and visually analyzed using graphs. It provides practical exposure to API usage, data processing, and visualization techniques. 

The project is structured in a simple and understandable way, making it suitable for beginners while still covering important programming concepts. By completing this project, I gained hands-on experience in working with APIs, processing dynamic data, implementing logic to find maximum values, and presenting results visually in a meaningful way.
